# 🌱 FasaL

FasaL is a mobile and web application designed to help farmers learn more about their crops and make informed decisions on crop health and fertilizer requirements. Our project was developed as part of the Smart BU Hackathon organized by Bennett University, where we placed 46th out of 400+ teams.

## 📱 Features

- **Crop Disease Detection**: Our application includes 5 AI models to detect crop diseases, giving farmers a quick and reliable diagnosis to safeguard their crops.
- **Fertilizer Level Recommendations**: Based on the crop and its condition, our AI models recommend the required fertilizer levels to optimize crop growth.
- **Web and Mobile Accessibility**: Farmers can access our service via a mobile app or the web, ensuring wide accessibility.
- **User-Friendly Design**: The interface provides an easy-to-use experience for farmers, making advanced AI tools accessible even to those without technical knowledge.

## 🚀 Technologies

- **AI Models**: Python, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow.
- **Mobile App Prototype**: Swift, Figma, React Native.
- **Web Application**: HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, React.
- **Design**: Figma.

## 💡 Goal

We want to empower farmers with the knowledge and tools to improve their crop yield and combat diseases effectively using AI. With both mobile and web platforms, we aim to provide easy access to critical information for farmers, ensuring they have all the resources they need in one place.
